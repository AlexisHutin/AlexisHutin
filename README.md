# Hey there, I'm Alexis! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a developer based in Rennes, passionate about crafting innovative solutions and exploring emerging technologies. 
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me managing my homelab server, where I host a variety of services ranging from self-hosted applications to experimental projects. 
I have a deep-seated passion for new technologies and love to dive into experimentation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and learning along the way.

For more details on my homelab setup and projects, check out [my homelab repository ðŸ§ª](https://github.com/AlexisHutin/home_lab/tree/main).
