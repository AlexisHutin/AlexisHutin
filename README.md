# Hey there, I'm Alexis! 👋

## About Me

I'm a developer based in Rennes, passionate about crafting innovative solutions and exploring emerging technologies. 
When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me managing my homelab server, where I host a variety of services ranging from self-hosted applications to experimental projects. 
I have a deep-seated passion for new technologies and love to dive into experimentation, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and learning along the way.

<!-- For more details on my homelab setup and projects, check out [my homelab repository](link_to_homelab_repo). -->
